## ⚠️ Disclaimer
As a beginner in 3D web development, I want to be transparent about the current state of this project:

The site may experience significant lag and performance issues.
3D rendering and interactions might not be optimized, leading to a potentially choppy user experience.
Load times may be longer than ideal, especially on less powerful devices.

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Please understand that this project is a learning experience for me, and I am actively working on improving its performance and efficiency.
